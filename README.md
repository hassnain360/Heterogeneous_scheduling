#  Performance Analysis of Different Hardware Architectures in a Heterogeneous Computing Platform

## Introduction: 
Latest workloads in modern databases are varying and dynamic in nature. Databases running such workloads and equipped with heterogeneous hardware like CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs need intelligent scheduling algorithms that can intelligently decide what hardware to offload each task to.

This project aims to research and test some of such scheduling algorithms.

 ## Initial Individual HW testing on Cloud Lab: 

As a first step, this requires us to test different workloads individually on each of the available hardware in the heterogeneous systems.

We do this on the Cloud Lab Clemson ibm8335 node, which has:
1.  CPU: Two ten-core (8 threads/core) IBM POWER8NVL CPUs at 2.86 GHz
2.  RAM: 256GB 1600MHz DDR4 memory
3.  Disk: Two Seagate 1TB 7200 RPM 6G SATA HDDs (ST1000NX0313)
4.  NIC: One Broadcom NetXtreme II BCM57800 1/10 GbE NIC
5.  GPU: NVIDIA GP100GL (Tesla P100 SMX2 16GB)
6.  FPGA: One ADM-PCIE-KU3 (Xilinx Kintex UltraScale)


12/21/2020: Awaiting Project Approval from CloudLab.
