# Setting up the IBM8335 Node on CloudLab

1. You need 2 things:
    -   A script for installation of any ubuntu on any specific hardware.
    -   Configuration of that script to use 'ibm8335' as hardware, and the ubuntu-ppc64le as the system image.

2. Another way is to just make a profile and edit the node by going in 'edit' topology, and clicking the node and selecting HW and the image.
    -   You can also find all the compatible OS images from this screen for your selected HW.
